## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

:wrench: I'm currently working on a SwiftUI project that explores declarative frameworks. Vapor serves as the backend, with SwiftUI handling frontend interfaces.

:hammer_and_wrench: I'm working with a Chingu Team on a Voyage - a single page React, Redux, Angular Validators and Next.js project.
